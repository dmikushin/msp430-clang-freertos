/******************************************************************************
 * NOTE 1:  This project provides two demo applications.  A simple blinky style
 * project, and a more comprehensive test and demo application.  The
 * mainCREATE_SIMPLE_BLINKY_DEMO_ONLY setting in main.c is used to select
 * between the two.  See the notes on using mainCREATE_SIMPLE_BLINKY_DEMO_ONLY
 * in main.c.  This file implements the simply blinky style version.
 *
 * NOTE 2:  This file only contains the source code that is specific to the
 * basic demo.  Generic functions, such FreeRTOS hook functions, and functions
 * required to configure the hardware, are defined in main.c.
 ******************************************************************************
 *
 * main_blinky() creates one queue, two tasks, and one software timer.  It then
 * starts the scheduler.
 *
 * The Blinky Software Timer:
 * This demonstrates an auto-reload software timer.  The timer callback function
 * does nothing but toggle an LED.
 *
 * The Queue Send Task:
 * The queue send task is implemented by prvQueueSendTask() in main_blinky.c.
 * prvQueueSendTask() repeatedly blocks for 200 milliseconds before sending the
 * value 100 to the queue that was created in main_blinky().
 *
 * The Queue Receive Task:
 * The queue receive task is implemented by prvQueueReceiveTask() in
 * main_blinky.c.  prvQueueReceiveTask() repeatedly blocks on attempts to read
 * from the queue that was created in main_blinky(), toggling an LED each time
 * data is received. The queue send task sends data to the queue every 200
 * milliseconds, so the LED will toggle every 200 milliseconds.
